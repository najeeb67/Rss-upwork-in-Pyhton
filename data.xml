                <![CDATA[We need a real-time dashboard that our clients can access. <br /><br />
The dashboard can be hosted anywhere (dedicated server, off the shelf solution, AWS, etc). I&#039;m open to ideas.<br /><br />
It needs to be able to be updated via POST request with no limit on how many API calls we can make. It needs to be able to display an unlimited number of charts and graphs. It needs to have information sorted by tabs.<br /><br />
I would prefer to simply generate the charts as images on my back end and then transmit those images via post request and have them displayed for the customer. That seems like the simplest option so we don&#039;t need to worry about formatting the data. <br /><br />
We also need the customer to be able to download .csv files that will be automatically uploaded to the dashboard.<br /><br />
Clients will need to be able to access it by a generated password of some sort that can be generated and removed via POST request so I can automate it.<br /><br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $3,000

            <link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/Creative-Website-Designer-Agency-Needed-for-SaaS-Company-Concept-Development_%7E011c4534a584dd41ea?source=rss</link>
            <description>
                <![CDATA[** This is a repost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent engagement did not result in a useable design **<br /><br />
We are a dynamic SaaS company in search of an innovative website designer or agency to collaborate with us on developing 2-3 unique website concepts. This project serves as the foundational step in our journey to revolutionize our online presence, aiming to align closely with our marketing strategies and effectively communicate our value proposition to our target audience.<br /><br />
Project Overview:<br />
Initial Task: The selected candidate or agency will be tasked with creating concepts for three key components of our website:<br /><br />
1. Main Site Landing Page: The front door to our online presence, setting the tone for our brand and inviting engagement.<br /><br />
2. Product Page: A detailed showcase of our software solutions, designed to inform and entice potential customers.<br /><br />
3. Interactive Page/Design: A unique page allowing visitors to experience our AI technology firsthand by uploading an image or video.<br /><br />
Site Development:&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a WIX/Wordpress site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please skip this if that&rsquo;s your primary technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll expect Figma designs that our dev team can implement in React or other similar framework.<br /><br />
This initial phase is critical for us to assess the creativity, efficiency, and alignment of the designer or agency with our marketing objectives. We are not providing detailed copy at this stage; please use placeholder text (e.g., &amp;quot;lorem ipsum&amp;quot;) or derive basic content ideas from our discussions.<br /><br />
Objectives:<br />
- Develop 2-3 website concepts that reflect our SaaS company&#039;s innovative spirit and market positioning.<br /><br />
- Showcase your ability to translate marketing concepts into engaging, user-friendly web designs.<br /><br />

                <![CDATA[** This is a repost.&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent engagement did not result in a useable design **<br /><br />
We are a dynamic SaaS company in search of an innovative website designer or agency to collaborate with us on developing 2-3 unique website concepts. This project serves as the foundational step in our journey to revolutionize our online presence, aiming to align closely with our marketing strategies and effectively communicate our value proposition to our target audience.<br /><br />
Project Overview:<br />
Initial Task: The selected candidate or agency will be tasked with creating concepts for three key components of our website:<br /><br />
1. Main Site Landing Page: The front door to our online presence, setting the tone for our brand and inviting engagement.<br /><br />
2. Product Page: A detailed showcase of our software solutions, designed to inform and entice potential customers.<br /><br />
3. Interactive Page/Design: A unique page allowing visitors to experience our AI technology firsthand by uploading an image or video.<br /><br />
Site Development:&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not a WIX/Wordpress site.&nbsp;&nbsp;Please skip this if that&rsquo;s your primary technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&rsquo;ll expect Figma designs that our dev team can implement in React or other similar framework.<br /><br />
This initial phase is critical for us to assess the creativity, efficiency, and alignment of the designer or agency with our marketing objectives. We are not providing detailed copy at this stage; please use placeholder text (e.g., &amp;quot;lorem ipsum&amp;quot;) or derive basic content ideas from our discussions.<br /><br />

I am looking for someone to help me on a slight website theme modification.<br />
My website is working perfectly except the mobile menu drop down, which I am not happy with.<br />
Once you click on the menu toggle on a mobile, there is an arrow on the right side to activate the menu item. However, I would also like the menu items to be responsive if you click on them.<br /><br />
Is this something you could help with?<br />

            <description>
                <![CDATA[We are seeking an experienced Next.js developer to integrate our existing web application with the SEI blockchain. The primary goals are to enable connectivity with cryptocurrency wallets, display user&#039;s NFT and token holdings from their connected wallet, and calculate/visualize profit and loss for those assets over time.<br /><br />
We already have a next.js codebasis and the Backend will be deployed by another developer.<br /><br />
Tasks which need to do by you:<br />
- Integrating crypto wallets and enabling wallet connections within the application. (compass, Keplr, Seif, Leap...)<br />
- Implementing user authentication (almost done) and storing data in a custom database.<br />
- Connecting our own implemented API for fetching data and handling API integration.<br />
- Fixing UI issues and ensuring responsive design across different devices and screen sizes.<br />
- calculations from SEI to $ &amp;amp; &euro; on tx date<br /><br /><br />
Please let me know if you are interested and if you are availible. Then I can share you more details :)<br /><br />
